\chapter{\mychapter}
Moving from logic to some more recognizable mathematics, we will first introduce the concept of a set.
We will split the section into two parts: one dedicated to na\"ive set theory, and an introduction to more formal set theory.
For mathematicians, na\"ive set theory is sufficient to make sense of most mathematical concepts, but as it turns out, formalizing set theory gives us a concrete way to trace back complicated concepts like infinity to relatively simple ones like first-order logic.
I will try to give a sneak peek to the reader of this prospect at the end of this chapter.
